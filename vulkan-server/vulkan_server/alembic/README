Generic single-database configuration with Python logging.

This directory contains Alembic migrations for vulkan-server (open-source).

These migrations manage the database schema for the open-source deployment,
including core models from vulkan-engine:
- Policy, PolicyVersion, Workflow, Component
- DataSource, DataSourceCredential, DataSourceEnvVar
- Run, RunGroup, RunDataCache, RunDataRequest
- StepMetadata, DataObject, ConfigurationValue, WorkflowDataDependency

All models inherit from the same SQLAlchemy Base (from vulkan_engine.db).
