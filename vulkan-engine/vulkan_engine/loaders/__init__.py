"""
Resource loaders for vulkan-engine.

This module provides data access layer classes that handle loading resources
from the database. Loaders are responsible for:
- Resource retrieval and filtering
- Project-scoped access control
- Consistent error handling

Loaders are used by services to avoid code duplication and maintain
separation of concerns between data access and business logic.
